			<p>Eric is an experienced and dedicated volunteer and an extra class amateur radio operator with a passion for service. He has volunteered for organizations such as the Bloomington Minnesota AUXCOMM, the American Red Cross Phoenix Arizona Chapter DST group, the Minneapolis-St.Paul Airport Police department, the MSP Airport Foundation, and as the membership chairperson for the Twin Cities Chapter of ISC2.</p>
			<p>Eric is excited to jump into the project and help make it even better. He plans to work with the community to accept patches and modernize the code. Some of the updates planned include upgrading the version of PHP and MySQL or MariaDB database. Eric is asking the community to submit their patches and feature requests via the mailing list on google groups.</p>
			<p>We look forward to working with Eric and the Tickets CAD community to make this open source project even more amazing!</p>

        	<div class="content-txtbox-noshade">
          	<p>If you have come by the web site you will have noticed that it hasn't been updated in a long time. 
          	The primary cause was returning to school to finally get my degree. With work and family, school took 
          	up the majority of time I might have had left. As a result, a number of activities took a back seat
          	and the OpenISES project was one of those activities. </p>
          	<p>
          	One project that did not fall to the side was the Tickets project. Thanks to on-going hard work of 
          	Arnie Shore and the rest of the gang involved with the Tickets CAD project, we are pleased to report 
          	that project is still going strong. See our article below for the latest updates and how you can get 
          	a copy of Tickets</p>
				<p>
				For the OpenISES project, it will take some time to get our stuff back up and running. This web page
				is just a first step. We are reorganizing the site and reviewing the projects that will be made available.
				We hope that you will come back on occassion to see where we are as we bring the OpenISES project back to 
				life.</p>

					<p class="content-subtitle-noshade-size1">Experience freedom</p>
        			<div class="content-txtbox-noshade">
          		<p>Much of the software used by emergency services today comes in a "one size fits all" box. It
          	makes no difference if the community is 600 or 600,000. For many of the smaller agencies
          	the cost of such software is simply out of reach. Through the use of open source software, we
          	can help you meet your specific software needs and not pillage your budget.</p>
				<p>
				The use of open source software allows you to have access to the software code, the very thing
				that allows the software to function. By having access to the source code, you can modify the
				software to do what you need it to do, not what someone in a high-rise office building thinks you should 
				be doing. This gives you the freedom to modify, change and most importantly share the software 
				with your fellow providers. All of our software projects are required to be open source, using 
				an open source license recognized by the Open Source Definition. Because our software is created 
				by volunteers, there is no charge for any program and there never will be.</p>
